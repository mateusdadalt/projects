# RD Station Power BI Report 
### Lead capture tool with Power Automate, Sharepoint and Power BI
This Power BI report queries a JSON file containing lead data, which is generated via a webhook integration between RD Station and Power Automate. The automated flow stores new leads in a Sharepoint folder, creating a dynamic and queryable database for reporting purposes.

### Context and goal
The company launched a marketing campaing for an educational course. A subscription form created using RD Station was embbeded on a landing page. Stakeholders needed to monitor the campaing's performance and access a centralized, shareable lead database.
